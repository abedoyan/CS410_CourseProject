In order to be able to run this code, you will need to use the Gensim toolkit. 

Gensim runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, and should run on any other platform that supports Python and NumPy. The documentation says that Gensim is tested with Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8. I used Python 3.8.7 on a Windows computer.
